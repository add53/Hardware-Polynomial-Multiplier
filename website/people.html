                I am a senior studying Computer Engineering at NAU. Digital design is fascinating
                to me, and hence, I was excited to work on this project. I hope to have a career
                in digital signal processing in the audio industry, making the tools I learn in
                this project very applicable.

                As a Computer Engineering major at Northern Arizona University, 
                I've learned many things about the ins and outs of computers. 
                Such as coding, electrical components, digital signal processing, and embedded systems. 
                I want to further my skill set and provide advanced technology for generations to come. 
                With quantum computing reaching greater potential in the near future,

                I am interested in quantum computers and their impact on electronics and 
                current programming methods. I also enjoy working with FPGA boards, 
                so I am excited to work on this project and learn about post-quantum cryptography techniques.
